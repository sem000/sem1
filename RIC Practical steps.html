RIC Practical 3

A) Perform testing of Hypothesis using one sample t-test

One sample t-test : The One Sample t Test determines whether the sample mean is statistically different from a known or hypothesised population mean. The One Sample t Test is a parametric test.
p value is a number, calculated from a statistical test, that describes how likely you are to have found a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis were true. P values are used in hypothesis testing to help decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
Dataset - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q_h1lB458ireuwNR8lSuv5uL-OmwnnC7/view

Code:
OnesampleTtest.py
from scipy.stats import ttest_1samp
import numpy as np
ages = np.genfromtxt('ages.csv')
print(ages)
ages_mean = np.mean(ages)
print(ages_mean)
tset, pval = ttest_1samp(ages, 30)
print('p-values - ',pval)
if pval< 0.05: # alpha value is 0.05
  print(" we are rejecting null hypothesis")
else:
  print("we are accepting null hypothesis")


B2) Perform testing of hypothesis using two sample t-test
Two Sample t Test 
Example: A college Princiapal informed classroom teachers that some of their students showedunusual potential for intellectual gains. One months later the students identified to teachers ashaving potentional for unusual intellectual gains showed significiantly greater gains performanceon a test said to measure IQ than did students who were not so identified. Below are the data forthe students:
Dataset – 
https://vsitedu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/asif_rampurawala_vsit_edu_in/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC3AAEDC2-1D5D-48BA-8BD0-950156BD7BE3%7D&file=Pract%2003%20t-Test.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true

Steps:
1) First calculate mean and standard deviation.
To Calculate Standard Mean go to cell A22 and type=SUM(A2:A21)/20
To Calculate Standard Deviation, go to cell A23 and type=STDEV(A2/A21)
To Calculate Standard Mean go to cell A22 and type=SUM(A2:A21)/20
To Calculate Standard Deviation, go to cell A23 and type=STDEV(A2/A21)
2) T-test statistics
To find T-test Statistics go to Data→In the Ribbon Click on Data Analysis
Data Analysis window will be open→Select t-test: Paired Two Sample for Means in Analysis Tools section→click on OK
t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means window will open 
→Select Experiment column (A1:A21) in Variable 1 Range
→Select Comparison Column (B1:B21) in variable 2 Range
→Tick the Lables checkbox
→Select Output Range(D5:F14)
→Click on OK
3) To Calculate the T-Test square value 
go to cell E20
=(A22-B22)/SQRT((A23*A23)/COUNT(A2:A21)+(B23*B23)/COUNT(A2:A21))
4) Check H0 will be accepted or rejected
=IF(E20<E12,"H0 is accepted","H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted")




B2) Write a program for t-test comparing two means for independent variables
Code –
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
from numpy.random import randn
N = 20
a = 5 * randn(100) + 50
b = 5 * randn(100) + 51
var_a = a.var(ddof=1)
var_b = b.var(ddof=1)
s = np.sqrt((var_a + var_b)/2)
t = (a.mean() - b.mean())/(s*np.sqrt(2/N))
df = 2*N - 2
#p-value after comparison with the t
p = 1 - stats.t.cdf(t,df=df)
print("t = " + str(t))
print("p = " + str(2*p))
if t> p :
  print('Mean of two distribution are different and significant')
else:
  print('Mean of two distribution are same and not significant'


3C) Perform testing of hypothesis using paired t-test.
The paired sample t-test is also called dependent sample t-test. It’s an univariate test that tests for a significant difference between 2 related variables. An example of this is if you where to collect the blood pressure for an individual before and after some treatment, condition, or time point. The data set contains blood pressure readings before and after an intervention. These are variables “bp_before” and “bp_after”. 

The hypothesis being test is: 
• H0 - The mean difference between sample 1 and sample 2 is equal to 0. 
• H0 - The mean difference between sample 1 and sample 2 is not equal to 0.





Code:
Code & Output: 
from scipy import stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("blood_pressure.csv")
print(df[['bp_before','bp_after']].describe())
#First let’s check for any significant outliers in
#each of the variables.
df[['bp_before', 'bp_after']].plot(kind='box')
# This saves the plot as a png file
plt.savefig('boxplot_outliers.png')


# make a histogram to differences between the two scores.
df['bp_difference'] = df['bp_before'] - df['bp_after']
df['bp_difference'].plot(kind='hist', title= 'Blood Pressure Difference Histogram')
#Again, this saves the plot as a png file



plt.savefig('blood pressure difference histogram.png')
stats.probplot(df['bp_difference'], plot= plt)
plt.title('Blood pressure Difference Q-Q Plot')
plt.savefig('blood pressure difference qq plot.png')
stats.shapiro(df['bp_difference'])
stats.ttest_rel(df['bp_before'], df['bp_after'])





Reject Null Hypothesis
A paired sample t-test was used to analyse the blood pressure before and after the intervention to test if the intervention had a significant affect on the blood pressure. 
The blood pressure before the intervention was higher (156.45 ± 11.39 units) compared to the blood pressure post intervention (151.36 ± 14.18 units); t
here was a statistically significant decrease in blood pressure (t(119)=3.34, p= 0.0011) of 5.09 units.

Practical 6
A) Perform testing of Hypothesis using one-way Annova

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical test used to analyses the difference between the means of more than two groups.
Univariate ANOVA, also known as one-way ANOVA, is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference in the mean of a dependent variable among the levels of a single independent variable.
Dataset - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OC6k6I843GYiYjLWlwn78r9a41ANhJCm/view
https://youtu.be/Xy9DC6RO2R4

1) Open data set
2) Click on data analysis, then select Annova : single factor
3) For input select all Average data columns
4) For output range select any blank space below.
5) Compare the p value with 0.05
6) Conclusion - Since the resulting p value is less than 0.05. The null hypothesis (H0) is rejected and conclude that there is a significant difference between the SAT scores for each subject.




B) Perform testing of hypothesis using two-way ANOVA.
A two-way ANOVA is used to estimate how the mean of a quantitative variable changes according to the levels of two categorical variables. Use a two-way ANOVA when you want to know how two independent variables, in combination, affect a dependent variable.

Data set – 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QQpKtz-dYInyr87U5ctlr8cyem-kZhFO/view

1) open excel sheet
2) data analysis then, select “Annova – Two factor with replication”
3) Select the input, Input Range - $A$1:$C$61
Rows Per Sample – 30 (Because 30 Patients are given each dose) Alpha – 0.05 Output Range - $F$1:$M$24
4) P-value = 0.0588079 column in the ANOVA Source of Variation table at the bottom of the output. Because the p-values for both medicin dose and interaction are less than our significance level, these factors are statistically significant. On the other hand, the interaction effect is not significant because its p-value (0.0588) is greater than our significance level. Because the interaction effect is not significant, we can focus on only the main effects and not consider the interaction effect of the dose.
C) Multivariate (MANOVA)
MANOVA is used when there are multiple dependent variables, and it tests the null hypothesis that the means of the dependent variables are equal across groups, against the alternative hypothesis that at least one of the means is different. It is a powerful tool that allows researchers to investigate the relationship between multiple dependent variables and one or more independent variables.

Practical 7
Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population to estimate certain characteristics of that population.

Random sampling is done by generating a random sample of individuals from the population, usually by using random number generators or a table of random numbers. This method is relatively simple and inexpensive, and it is widely used in social and natural sciences research.One of the main advantages of random sampling is that it reduces the chances of bias, as every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.

Stratified sampling is a statistical method of sampling in which the population is divided into smaller groups, called strata, based on certain characteristics. The goal of stratified sampling is to ensure that the sample represents different subgroups of the population in proportion to their representation in the population. This can be beneficial when different subgroups within the population have different characteristics or when the population has a non-random distribution of certain characteristics.
